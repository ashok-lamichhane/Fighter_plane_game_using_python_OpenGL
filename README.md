# fighter_plane_game_using_python
I made this project using OpenGL in Python for the Computer Graphics Course. This project includes the basics of open GL, Midpoint circle algorithm, Midpoint line drawing, and two types of Transformation i.e. Rotation, Translation. You can take a hint from this project as you need to build something like this. I made this game full functioning as it have score as well as level feature with varying difficulty level and we can also set life for gamers.
For installing and viewing this project in python openGL you must install numpy and other basic openGL requirements.
